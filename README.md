# portfolio

**Live site:** https://metooha.github.io/portfolio/

The app is in `projects/portfolio` and is built/deployed by the **GitHub Actions** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`).

To publish the full site (not just this README), in the repo go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch").
