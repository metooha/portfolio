# Living Design Starter

A standalone Vite + React + Tailwind starter pre-loaded with Living Design components. Use it with Claude Code, Cursor, or any IDE to vibe quickly with the Living Design system.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** (see `.nvmrc`)
- **npm**

## Getting Started

```bash
# Point nvm at the Walmart Node.js mirror so installs work on-network
export NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR="https://repository.walmart.com/content/repositories/nodejs/"
nvm install          # install Node 22 (see .nvmrc) from the Walmart mirror
nvm use              # switch to Node 22
npm install          # install dependencies (registry + proxy are pinned in .npmrc)
npm run dev          # start dev server on http://localhost:3099
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
  App.tsx                  # Your starting point — edit this!
  main.tsx                 # React root mount (no need to touch)
  components/              # Atoms, molecules, single components — Button, Card, …
  patterns/                # Composed page-level recipes — Header, Footer, OrderCard, …
  common/                  # Internal helpers used across components (read-only)
  hooks/                   # Shared hook utilities (read-only)
  index.ts                 # Top-level barrel — @livingdesign/react resolves here
  utils/                   # Shared helpers: Theming.tsx, Store.tsx (read-only)
  styles/
    index.css              # Tailwind directives + LD CSS import
    living-design.css      # Combined LD component styles (generated)
```

## Using Components

Primitives live at `src/components/<Name>/`. Patterns (composed recipes) live at `src/patterns/<Name>/`:

```tsx
import { Button } from './components/Button';
import { Card } from './components/Card';
import { TextField } from './components/TextField';
import { Accordion } from './components/Accordion';
import { Header } from './patterns/Header';
import { OrderCard } from './patterns/OrderCard';
```

Skim `.cursor/rules/components-index.mdc` (or `.claude/rules/components-index.md`) for the component catalogue. For prop API + usage notes on a specific component, open the `<Name>.md` next to its `.tsx` (e.g. `src/components/Button/Button.md` or `src/patterns/Header/Header.md`) or run `npx ld-kit show <Name>`.

## Adding New Components

Create new components **outside** `src/components/` and `src/patterns/` — those directories are generated and read-only. Import and compose existing LD components in your own files.

## Context & Guidelines

- `.cursor/rules/` — Cursor IDE rules (auto-loaded)
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code agent instructions
- `AGENTS.md` — General agent orientation

## Accessibility runtime scanner (dev only)

This starter ships a dev-only accessibility scanner that runs in the browser and **covers the app with an unmissable red panel** whenever it detects common a11y defects (missing alt, unlabeled buttons, multiple `<h1>`, duplicate ids, clickable non-interactive elements, form controls without labels, etc.).

When violations exist you'll see:

- **In-page overlay** — a centered card titled `LD A11Y` listing every violation, with a "Copy violations" button. If a coding agent missed a defect, copy the panel contents and paste them back into your prompt.
- **`npm run dev` terminal banner** — violations print as a red `[LD A11Y]` block with numbered issues.

To inspect violations without opening DevTools:

```bash
# Machine-readable snapshot, written on every scan
cat .ld-a11y-report.json

# Live snapshot served by the dev server
curl http://localhost:3099/__ld_a11y_report
```

The scanner runs inside the browser, so the page must actually be loaded for violations to surface — a bare `curl /` won't trigger it. Use a browser, a browser-automation tool, or any agent that executes the page's JavaScript.

See `.cursor/rules/a11y.mdc` (or `.claude/rules/a11y.md`) for the full accessibility directive and the `unsafeDecorative={{ reason }}` opt-out contract.
